“If you don't get what you want, you suffer; if you get what you don't want, you
 suffer; even when you get exactly what you want, you still suffer because you
 can't hold on to it forever. Your mind is your predicament. It wants to be
 free of change. Free of pain, free of the obligations of life and death. But
 change is law and no amount of pretending will alter that reality.”
